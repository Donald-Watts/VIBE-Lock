1. **Standard MIT Terms**
   The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in
   all copies or substantial portions of the Software.

2. **Attribution‑Preservation Clause (Cognitive Fingerprint Schemas)**
   a. **Definition** – "Cognitive Fingerprint Schema" means any stylistic
   watermark, zero‑width character pattern, semantic n‑gram signature, or
   other machine‑detectable marker embedded by the original authors for the
   purpose of provenance verification, as documented in `VIBE‑PROTOCOL.md`.

   b. **Retention Requirement** – Any distribution of the Software—whether
   verbatim, modified, or incorporated into a larger work—**must preserve
   the original Cognitive Fingerprint Schema(s)** embedded in the source
   code, text, or assets unless explicit, written permission is granted by
   the original copyright holder.

   c. **Derivative Works** – If you create and distribute a derivative work
   that introduces additional fingerprint schemas, you **must**:
   i.   Document the new schema(s) clearly in human‑readable form.
   ii.  Ensure the original schema(s) remain intact and detectable.
   iii. Include attribution to the original authors alongside your own.

   d. **Redistribution of Stripped Versions** – Distribution of the Software
   with Cognitive Fingerprint Schema(s) deliberately removed or obfuscated
   is prohibited unless the removal has been authorized in writing by the
   original copyright holder.

3. **Liability of Fingerprint Integrity**
   The authors make no warranty, express or implied, that the Cognitive
   Fingerprint Schema(s) will remain intact under all compilation,
   minification, or transpilation processes.  Users modifying the Software are
   responsible for verifying schema integrity before redistribution.
